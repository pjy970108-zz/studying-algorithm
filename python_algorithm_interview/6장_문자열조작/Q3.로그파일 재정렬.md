# Q3. 로그파일 재정렬_leetcode937

***
You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
Reorder these logs so that:

The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
Return the final order of the logs.
***

Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]

Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]

Explanation:
The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".


~~~python
class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        letters, digits = [], []
        for log in logs: 
            if log.split()[1].isdigit(): #check list component type. if log can change numeric, the result of isdigit() will be true.
                digits.append(log)
            else:
                letters.append(log)
        
        letters.sort(key=lambda x: (x.split()[1:], x.split()[0])) #key_value: the first of char or num execpt log Identifier
        return letters+digits
